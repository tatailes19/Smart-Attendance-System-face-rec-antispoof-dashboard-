# Automated Anti-Spoof Face Recognition Attendance System with Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview

Developed an automated face recognition attendance system accompanied by a comprehensive dashboard for attendance data analysis and employee management. This project involved the implementation of a one-shot learning face recognition technique, allowing the model to learn from a single image and avoid the challenge of repetitive retraining. The system ensures accurate attendance tracking while detecting and preventing spoof attacks, distinguishing between live individuals and fraudulent attempts. The intuitive dashboard provides real-time insights, attendance reports, and efficient employee management functionalities, enhancing productivity and better understanding of behaviors for better decision-making.
